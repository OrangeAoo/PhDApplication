\subsubsection{Columbia University Stats Department}
\vspace{3pt}
\begin{adjustwidth}{10pt}{}
    Under prof Campbell's supervision, I worked as an RA on the extended topic to his work \textit{"Deep learning for principal-agent mean field
games."} \cite{SC} and its application in REC markets. Here are the major things I did.
\end{adjustwidth}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Built up the FBSDE-MFG model and NN framework with PyTorch to reproduced the results of 1-Period-2-Agent Model in \cite{SC}.
    \item Added additional period to the previous model and framework: Joint Optimization Model, considering for not just current but also future quotas. 
    \item Proposed 3 numeric tricks to improve the model stability in seek of desired convergence: \textit{clamp}, \textit{sigmoid approximation}, and \textit{logit transformation}.
    \item Experimented with different combos of NN model settings (e.g. optimizer, scheduler, layers etc.), parameters (e.g. lr), numeric tricks, and loss functions.
    \item Proposed a benchmark model - Separate Optimization Model - by running the 1P2A model twice, which gives a better view of differences made by long/short-sighted perspectives. 
    \item Wrapped up codes into well-defined packages, published to \MFG\ together with README instructions. 
    \item Wrote a Report-Overview for big pictures and Report-Stepwise for detailed math and algorithm illustrations. 
\end{itemize}

        \item Offshore wind industry in low-carbon transition: bottleneck and future.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Visualization - made all figures and tables for the report series. 
    \item Collected references for other sections of the report series. 
    \item Assisted completing and proof-reading the draft versions.
