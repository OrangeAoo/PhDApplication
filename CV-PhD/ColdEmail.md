# About Me 

![Sample](image.png)

My name is Orange(Yingzhi) Ao and I am completing my B.S. in Financial Engineering.

In 4 sentences, I'm going to show you WHY your research in Principle-Agent MFG and FBSDEs would benefit by having me, using the example of my most related research experience: Multi-Compliance MFG with Innovated Deep FBSDE Solvers (GitHub: https://github.com/OrangeAoo/Multi-Compliance-MFG-FBSDEs)

- [Skill] which will facilitate future pulications and report writing.
    - python + PyTorch + Git + Overleaf.
 
- [Background Knowledge] Prior research experience in green energy markets and courses PDE, SDE (and courses in progress like math finance etc.)

- [Ability/Potential] A fast-and-hungry learner, which will make me no worse than an M.S. holder 
    - I "earned" this research opportuniy by acing against other grad students in my supervisor's grad-level course _Applied Stochastic Process_ during my exchange in Columbia, with no prior exposure to similar courses. 
    - I picked up FBSDE-MFG basics, pytorch and overleaf(latex) and used them to build up this whole framework in 3 months.

- [Interest/Motivation]: Committed to Math Fin - all researches are about green energy markets and other projects/interns are (high-freq) stock markets, which I believe share some common points. 

Attached is a copy of my CV. And referrals available upon request. 

I would super appreciate it should you be willing to discuss any PhD opportunities with me!!

Sincerely and best regards,
Orange Ao
